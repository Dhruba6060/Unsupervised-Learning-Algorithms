#  A Study On Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques: Application to IoT Traffic

In this project, the IoT data set is analysed by many unsupervised algorithms
for anomaly analysis of the traffic by clustering. The IoT network traffic
is given in every unsupervised algorithms. After that results of the algorithms
is compared to find the best performing algorithm.
