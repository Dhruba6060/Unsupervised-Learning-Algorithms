#  A Study On Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques: Application to IoT Traffic

In this project, the IoT data set has been analysed by many unsupervised algorithms
for anomaly analysis of the traffic by clustering. The IoT network traffic
has given in every unsupervised algorithms. After that results of the algorithms
has compared to find the best performing algorithm using Internal and External validation Methods.


## Objectives
    • Study of Unsupervised learning algorithms.

    • Implementing unsupervised learning algorithms for IoT network traffic analysis.

    • To perform comparative analysis of the results.
